This is a sample project configured and setup to use Robolectric (droid-sugar).  This project shows how to configure
your build file, how to layout your project, sample tests, etc.

There are caveats:

    This project is setup to use IntelliJ.  There currently is no support for Eclipse (Eclipse makes assumptions
    about the project layout).  If you're interested in getting this running on Eclipse, we could use your help.

    Currently the library has some requirements on using the Google API's versions of the SDK.

- Create a new Android project (or copy this one and remove all the garbage you don't want).

- Add the Robolectric (droid-sugar) git submodule to your application. In the root of your application run:

     git submodule add git@github.com:pivotal/droid-sugar.git
